Check the file:
```
cat drop-in/flag.py
print("Printing the flag...")```
```

Check the other heads to get the commit id:
```
> cat drop-in/.git/refs/heads/feature/part-3
1308521d0d0b66df1a73e91d5d9e2d74610002e3

> cat drop-in/.git/refs/heads/feature/part-2
9792a89fa347abc711f84b7208db18d164d45aca

> cat drop-in/.git/refs/heads/feature/part-1
ad37f59bfdcb1e8052bf7e12e1d89a2adb315cf9
```

Get the different commits content:
```
> git checkout ad37f59bfdcb1e8052bf7e12e1d89a2adb315cf9 && cat flag.py

Previous HEAD position was 9792a89 add part 2
HEAD is now at ad37f59 add part 1
print("Printing the flag...")

print("picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_", end='')%


> git checkout 9792a89fa347abc711f84b7208db18d164d45aca && cat flag.py

HEAD is now at 9792a89 add part 2
print("Printing the flag...")

print("m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_", end='')%


> git checkout 1308521d0d0b66df1a73e91d5d9e2d74610002e3 && cat flag.py

HEAD is now at 1308521 add part 3
print("Printing the flag...")

print("w0rk_e4b79efb}")
```

I just copy pasted the parts of the flag hehe:
```
picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_e4b79efb}
```
